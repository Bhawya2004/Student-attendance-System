## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone or navigate to this repository:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/bhawyagulati/Documents/Student-attendance
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Notebooks

Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then navigate to `notebooks/day1_data_understanding.ipynb` to start exploring the data.

## Dataset

The dataset contains student performance data in mathematics, including various demographic, social, and school-related features.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Complete data exploration and understanding
